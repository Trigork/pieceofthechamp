# pieceofthechamp
LoL local skin tracker

Angular App to show and track stats from champs and skins from your local League of Legends client.

For now, it uses a locally dumped champion JSON file from a program like Fiddler but the plan
is to be able to send the request from this very app and get the file automatically.

Place the JSON file in the champs folder, the name should be:
``SummonerName_YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm.json``

## How do I run this?
Just open the pieceofthechamp.html file in your browser and boast about how much money
you have spent on a Free to Play game.
